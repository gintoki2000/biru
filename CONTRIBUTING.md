## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a brief view of how to set up development environment to contribute to this project

### Disclaimer

This project is in a very early stage, so things are expected to change a lot, including project structure and UI design, if you propose to make a big change in code or UI, discuss in [Issue](https://github.com/l4rzy/biru/issues) before doing any PRs. Also I'm quite new with Vala, so if you have experience working with Vala and want to help, you have my warmest welcome ;)

### Environment setup

* A working decent GNU/Linux environment is recommended, although compiling Vala code on Windows or MacOS is also possible, as pointed out at [ValaPlatforms](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/ValaPlatforms), but at the moment, we focus on developing features instead of making it cross-platform.
* An editor or IDE for code editing, I recommend using Geany, which is also my current developing environment, for code jumping and completion work pretty great with minimal configuration.
* We use [Uncrustify](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify) to uniform coding style, make sure that you have it installed and run `./format.sh` before doing any commits.
