## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a brief view of how to set up development environment to contribute to this project. 

### Disclaimer

This project is in a very early stage, so things are expected to change a lot, including project structure and UI design, if you propose to make a big change in code or UI, discuss in [Issue](https://github.com/l4rzy/biru/issues) before doing any PRs. Also I'm quite new with Vala, so if you have experience working with Vala and want to help, you have my warmest welcome ;)

### Environment setup

* A working decent GNU/Linux environment is recommended, although compiling Vala code on Windows or MacOS is also possible, as pointed out at [ValaPlatforms](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/ValaPlatforms), but at the moment, we focus on developing features instead of making it cross-platform.
* An editor or IDE for code editing, I recommend using Geany, which is also my current developing environment, for code jumping and completion work pretty great with minimal configuration.
* We use [Uncrustify](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify) to uniform coding style, make sure that you have it installed and run `./format.sh` before doing any commits.

###  Plan, tasks and assignments

We manage tasks and plans on our [Github Project](https://github.com/l4rzy/biru/projects). Checkout to see anything that you want and/or able to help, then fire an issue, waiting for assignments to make sure nobody else is working on your task, and you are ready to go. This project is pretty much beginner-friendly, so don't hesitate to contribute, I would be appreciating.
